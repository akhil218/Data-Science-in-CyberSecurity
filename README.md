# Data-Science-in-CyberSecurity
Stating the use of data science to provide a more detailed view of the most common cybersecurity attacks, what are the most accessed logical ports, visible patterns, as well as the trends and occurrence of attacks.

* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on -
    1. Attack Categories 
    2. Duration and Time of Attack
    3. IP Addresses and Ports/Services
* Calculating variance and testing a hypothesis to prove that the attacks are more performed on lower destination ports (they are not random)
* Recommendations for future planning and precautions
